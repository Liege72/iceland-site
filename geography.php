                Iceland's geography is a mix between volcanic landscapes and
                glaciers. Its position on and between the Eurasian and North
                American tectonic plates shape its rugged coastlines and even
                offer some unique perspectives on land and underwater; tectonic
                faults can clearly be seen on some parts of the massive island.
                Over 30 active volcanoes, 40 geothermal springs and frequent
                volcanic activity makes the Island very geologically active. A
                glacier called Vatnajökull (the largest in Europe) covers
                roughly 10% of the entire country. This fiery and icy island
                known as Iceland is breathtaking.<br />
                <br />As stated previously, Iceland is home to over 30 active
                volcanoes, including Eyjafjallajökull and Hekla, which are
                famous for their eruptions. Because of the island's many
                volcanoes, it is known as one of the most geologically active
                places on the planet. The volcanic activity and geothermal
                energy actually powers most of the country.<br />
                <br />On the other hand, Iceland is also home to some very large
                glaciers, which is why it is commonly referred to as “The Land
                of Fire and Ice.”
