                Iceland's remote location and rough terrain have strongly
                influenced its culture. Resilience, creativity, and a close bond
                with the natural world have shaped Icelanders' unique identity.
                Stories and mythology are used to commemorate the Viking
                settlers of Iceland who arrived ages ago. Visual arts and music
                are all part of Iceland's booming arts scene. <br />
                <br />
                Iceland's music scene is highly renowned, with globally
                recognized artists like Björk and Sigur Rós bringing
                international attention to the country. <br />
                <br />
                Film has also become an important part of Iceland’s artistic
                expression, with its dramatic landscapes often serving as
                destinations for international productions. The Reykjavík
                International Film Festival draws filmmakers from around the
                world. These artistic expressions show Iceland’s connection to
                its history and landscape.
