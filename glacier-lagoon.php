                Located in Vatnajökull National Park, the Jökulsárlón Glacier
                Lagoon is one of the most surreal sights in Iceland where
                massive icebergs drift in crystal clear waters. Seals live in
                the deep waters below, and are frequently spotted swimming among
                the ice. Because of the glacier's gradual retreat and climate
                change, the Jökulsárlón Lagoon has expanded over time. <br />
                <br />
                The lagoon eventually connects to the Atlantic Ocean through a
                short river. Sometimes during low tide, some of the icebergs
                make their way to the nearby Diamond Beach, where they rest
                along the black sand shore. <br />
                <br />
                Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon is a must-see destination for anyone
                visiting Iceland. Whether viewed from land, or a boat tour that
                travels between the icebergs, this natural wonder captures the
                raw beauty of Iceland's incredible landscape.
