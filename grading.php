    <h1>Grading Criteria</h1>
    <h3>Good Design Techniques - CRAP</h3>
    <span>
        I designed the website with the CRAP principles in mind. I ensured that 
        the colors of text were appropriate to the images they were on top of 
        (contrast). In cases where white text blended into the image behind it 
        too much, I put a text shadow. I also made sure to keep a similar page 
        design throughout the website. Alignment is also maintained throughout 
        the site. I also considered the proximity of elements on each page making 
        sure nothing is too close or too far to/from something else.
    </span>
    <h3>Organization of information – text and graphics make sense</h3>
    <span>Each page has images related to the text on the page.</span>
    <h3>Content – interesting read, excellent grammar, perfect spelling</h3>
    <span>I wrote ~1100 words that are hopefully spelled correctly!</span>
    <h3>Navigation – easy to get around, intuitive, well labeled</h3>
    <span>
        I believe it is. The navbar and footer make sure the viewer doesn’t lose 
        track of where they are.
    </span>
    <h3>Use of HTML5 and CSS3 (both text and positioning)</h3>
    <span>
        I used both HTML and CSS… and some JS.
    </span>
    <h3>
        A separate linked "Reference" page (in addition to the 10 required 
        content pages. You will lose 10% for not having a "References" page.
    </h3>
    <span>
        I have a “references” page.
