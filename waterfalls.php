                Iceland is well known for its magnificent and powerful
                waterfalls. In fact, some of Iceland's most spectacular
                waterfalls can be found with a quick Google Images search for
                "waterfall." Mother nature has skillfully sculpted each of the
                stunning waterfalls over millions of years. Visitors are able to
                wander behind Seljalandsfoss, a 60-meter-tall waterfall, for a
                very unique experience. The mist from this strong waterfall
                could blind you as you approach. The waterfalls of Iceland
                demonstrate the strength and beauty of mother nature. <br>
                <br>
                Another famous waterfall is Skógafoss. Its wide, and powerful
                flow of water falling from high above often creates rainbows in
                the mist. There is also Gullfoos, or “Golden Waterfall.” This
                waterfall is a part of Iceland's famous “Golden Circle.”<br>
                <br>
                These waterfalls, with their powerful, yet graceful displays of
                force perfectly embody Iceland's raw beauty. They serve as
                reminders of how rugged yet majestic Iceland's landscape can be.
