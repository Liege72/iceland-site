                The Aurora Borealis, or the Northern Lights are a magical and
                natural phenomena. From September through April, the Northern
                Lights can put on a show almost every night for viewers. The
                colorful curtains of light are truly a sight to see.<br />
                <br />The Northern Lights are most often seen as shades of green
                and yellow, but if youâ€™re lucky, you may experience the rare
                shades of pink, red, violet, and even blue. These color patterns
                are not only beautiful, but a fascinating example of the
                interaction between our sun and Earth's magnetic fields.<br />
                <br />What makes the lights so remarkable is their
                unpredictability. They can appear almost every night in the
                Northernmost and Southernmost parts of the Earth. Given a clear
                sky, little light pollution and the solar activity, you should
                have a good chance of witnessing the inspiring and magical
                Aurora Borealis.
